# Undergraduate Dissertation

This is my dissertation that was completed as part of my undergraduate studies. The title is 'Evidencing the use of spatial analysis and how this can be applied in the football industry to highlight the market potential'. I used census and lifestyle data to create a geodemographic index that finds areas of London that are more likely to be home to people who will support a certain football club. For this study, Bromley FC was used, however the index can be applied to other clubs in Greater London.
